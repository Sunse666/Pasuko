- Press `J` and `K` to move the selection up and down, press Tab to input the selected item at the current cursor position; note that this inputs one character at a time.

- If you copy too many entries, you can choose to press the `F` key in normal mode to enter search mode. This mode adds a text box (edit); enter text to search, just like using other editors with prompts. After finding the content you need, press Enter, use `J` and `K` to select, `Tab` to input, and after input is complete, it will return to normal mode. If you want to cancel the search or the result is not what you want, press `Esc` to exit the search.
